# Visibility Graph Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of a rotational plane sweep algorithm for computing [visibility graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visibility_graph), with visualization to aid in understanding the steps of the algorithm. The application was developed using JavaScript and the p5.js library.

This application was created as the final project for the Computational Geometry course at AGH UST during the 2022/2023 academic year. The repository includes reports and presentations (in Polish) that were part of the project.

## Launching the Application

There are two options for running the application:
1. Enter [this link](https://editor.p5js.org/Szyntos/sketches/2SYD7g12Z) - the application is hosted on the p5.js web editor and can be launched by clicking the play button in the upper-left corner.
2. Clone the repository and host the server locally by using Visual Studio Code editor with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). After launching the server, a site with a starting canvas should be displayed. The window may need to be resized as the application is not responsive.

Full documentation and user guide are available in the [reports](https://github.com/dadamczykk/Visibility_Graph/tree/main/reports) folder.
